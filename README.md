<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
![image1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bee2805/COVID19Dashboard/main/src/Img/Mockup1.jpg)

### Project Description

This is a data driven web application
using Node.js and React. I used two API’s that consist of COVID19
data. I used this API to dynamically input the information throughout
my web application, and I also used Charts.js to showcase the data
visually.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

### All The Latest COVID19 Data! 

I made use of the COVID19 API's to collect data and implement it into an awesome react experience.

### See COVID19 Global data!

On the Front Page you'll be able to see all the Cases, deaths and Recoveries worldwide!

![image4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bee2805/COVID19Dashboard/main/src/Img/ComparisonPage.png)
### Compare COVID statistics!

On the Comparison page you'll be able to compare data between population, cases, deaths and recoveries filtered by country!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

### Ideation

### Wireframes

![image7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bee2805/COVID19Dashboard/main/src/Img/Wireframe1.jpg)

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* API End Point: link Here 
* `Plugin` for this.
* ETC.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
What I enjoyed most about this project was seeing how
react worked and implementing my data dynamically
into the charts. It was really awesome to see the data
visualized, and I must say, Charts.js made me
completely geek out!

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
In the beginning I
also struggled with classes and constructors and I also
had issues with my chosen API and ended up having
to restart the project.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

I do believe I could have done a lot better in terms of
styling. I wish to improve my skills with Charts.js and
React. I believe next term I will be able to do my 10%
above and beyond.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
